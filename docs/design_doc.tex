    \item  Library used: libgdx

    \item  View: 2d (not isometric)

  For the presentation (questions taken from the slides)

  \begin{itemize}
    \item What do you want to do?\\
    A 2D strategy game (think age of empires, though it could be more focused on the management side, alternative: like clash of clans). You have to collect resources and build buildings.

    \item What is the UX going to be?\\
    There's a main menu with options to start a new game, resume game, and settings
    New game: start instantly (stretch goal: map generation)
    Resume game: shows a list of previous saves.

    \item Where in your project are the significant Java-related contributions?\\
    It's entirely in Java.

    \item How will you collaborate?\\
    We plan to work mostly in an independent way, but for more difficult features we can do pair-programming.

    \item What platform?\\
    We are targeting the desktop platform, though the library that we use also supports android, but it's less optimal for a strategy game.

    \item What APIs \& libraries?\\
    We plan to use the libgdx library, which is a very powerful framework dedicated to develop games. It offers a huge amount of classes, which handle graphics, audio, input/output, and much more.
