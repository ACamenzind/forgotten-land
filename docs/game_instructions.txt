GAME LOGIC

Objective:
The aim of the game is to gather as many _resources_ as possible, and make the total _population_ grow.
You will _lose_ when there are no people left.

Build:
In order to build a building, you have to place it inside the _blue influence area_.

Collecting resources:
Resource generators: market -> gold, castle -> people, farm -> food
Resource collectors: lumber camp -> wood, mine -> rock (they need to be place nearby their respective resource on the map, and will consume them)

Maximum resources:
The maximum count is related to the number of _houses_ (for people) and _warehouses_ that you have.

Population:
You have a total population, divided in _workers_ and _unemployed_.
Unemployed are those you can put in a building, while workers are those who are currently gathering resources.
The food consumption depends on the total population.

Maintenance cost:
Each building has a _maintenance_ cost, that is each turn it will consume a certain amount of resources.
If there aren't enough resources, it will start _degrading_ and eventually _collapse_ if not repaired.

World events:
Sometimes during the game a _random even_t can happen, that could _damage_ buildings or _kill_ some of the population.
